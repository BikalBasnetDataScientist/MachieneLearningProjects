# Student Intervention Need Detector
Detect the need for  intervention, so as to  increase ths student graduation rate with timely assistance, guidance and intervention.

#Description: 
In this project, we use the students data to analyse and detect then need for study intervention, with the ultimate aim of increasing  the student graduation rate.

We used various Supervised Statistical Learning models rangind from Logistic Regression Classifer to Decision Tree to Support Vector Machiene to Naive Bayes model to Random Forest to find the best need detector model.


## Getting Started Guide:
Step 1 : You need to install ipython and  jupyter notebook as
```
pip install ipython
pip install jupyter
```

Step 2: Go to the directory containing the project then open the notebook as
```
jupyter notebook
```

Step 3:  Then jupyter notebook will open in the browser. 

Step 4: Traverse to the ".ipynb" file and you can then change or run the program as desired in the browser notebook itself.

## Project Structure
- "student-data.csv" : The data  containing the student attributes . 
- "student_intervention.html" : This is the "html" version of the project and can be directly viewed in the browser.
- "student_intervention.ipynb" : This is the  ipython notebook file of the project. If you want to tweak it, make changes and play around, then you can open the ipython notebook file in the jupyter notebook and run it directly in your browser, as you go on making the changes.

## Naming Convention
The naming convention  of the projects  uses the series number. Each series has special significance as in,
- 1xx - series is reserved for the Supervised Learning
- 2xx - series is reserved for Computer Vision projects
- 3xx - series is reserved for time-series projects
- 4xx - series is reserved for NLP projects
- 5xx - series is reserved for Reinforcement Learning Projects
- 6xx - series is reserved for Clustering Projects
- 8xx - series is reserved for MlOps
- 9xx - series is reserved for parameter tuning

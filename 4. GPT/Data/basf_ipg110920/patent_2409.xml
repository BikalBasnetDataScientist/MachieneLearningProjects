 <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
 <p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to novel modified polyaminoamides which are useful as dispersing agents for particulate inorganic solids, especially for inorganic pigments such as clay minerals. The new polyamides are also useful as graying inhibiting additives and detergency boosting additives in washing compositions for laundry.</p>
 <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Washing of textile in aqueous wash liquor is a complex process involving the cooperative interaction of numerous physical and chemical influences. A fundamental distinction exists between the primary step, in which soil is removed from a substrate (primary detergency), and secondary stabilization in the wash liquor of dispersed or molecularly dissolved soil (second detergency). If a less than optimal detergent formulation is employed, some or all of the soil may at some point return to the fibers (redeposition). This is termed a wash liquor showing &#x201c;insufficient soil anti-redeposition capability&#x201d;. After repeated washing the problem becomes especially apparent as a distinct graying of the laundry, which scarcely can be reversed.</p>
 <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain polymers are known to be useful for preventing the redeposition of soil by stabilizing the soil in the wash liquor. Amongst these are carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), huminic acid, polyacrylic acid and copolymers of maleic acid and acrylic acid (see Powdered Detergents, Editor: Michael S. Showell, Surfactant Sci. Ser., Vol. 71, Marcel Decker, New York 1998, pages 111-114; Liquid Detergents, Editor, Kuo-Yann Lai, Surfactant Sci. Ser., Vol. 67, Marcel Decker, New York 1997, page 303). However, their action with regard to particulate soil, such as organic and especially inorganic, pigments, such as oxides, carbonates and silicates, in particular clay minerals, is poor. Moreover their anti-redeposition capability decreases with increasing water hardness. Also, anionic surfactants may impair their activity.</p>
 <p id="p-0005" num="0004">Polyaminoamides are known to be polymers whose backbone chain contains both amino functionalities (NH) and amide functionalities (NH&#x2014;C(O)). Modified polyaminoamides containing polyether side chains, which are attached to the amino nitrogen atoms of the polymer backbone and, if present, to the amino nitrogen atoms of the end-groups of the polymer, are known e.g. from GB 1218394, EP 1025839, EP 1192941 and WO03/050219. In the modified polyaminoamides of prior art the number average of the repeating units in the polyether side chain is in most cases from 1 to 6. Up to now, polyaminoamides have neither been suggested as anti-redeposition agents nor to be useful for assisting in soil removal.</p>
 <p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consequently, there is ongoing need for compounds which are useful as detergent auxiliaries for preventing redeposition of soil and for assisting in soil removal. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compounds which have good soil removal properties and good dispersing properties for particulate soil, especially for organic and inorganic pigments, in particular for clay minerals. These properties should be maintained even in hard water and in the presence of interfering substances such as anionic surfactants. Moreover, these compounds should be readily incorporated into both solid and liquid laundry detergent formulations and should not impair their stability.</p>
 <p id="p-0007" num="0006">These objects are surprisingly achieved by modified polyaminoamides, wherein at least a part of the amino nitrogens of the polymer backbone and, if present, of the amino end groups carry both a radical R as defined below and a polyether moiety of the formula I as defined below.</p>

However, it is advantageous, if the components in the reaction are volatile as is the case when R<sup>1 </sup>is hydrogen. The reaction pressure can be up to 50 bar, preferably up to 10 bar. Thereby, a polyaminoamide is obtained wherein most or all of the hydrogen atoms in the amino groups of the starting material are replaced by a radical CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CR<sup>1</sup>R&#x2014;OH, wherein R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>are as above (i.e. side chains of formula I with p=1).</p>
 <p id="p-0052" num="0068">To obtain modified polyamidoamines carrying side chains of formula I, with p being greater than 1, the thus obtained polyaminoamide is reacted with further amounts of epoxide of formula II. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base as catalyst. Examples of suitable bases are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides, e.g. the sodium and the potassium alkoxides of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>-alkanols, such as sodium methoxide sodium ethoxide and potassium t-butoxide, and also sodium hydride and calcium hydride and alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. Preferred bases are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal alkoxides. The base is generally used in an amount of from 0.05 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 2% by weight, based on the total amount of the starting materials.</p>
 <p id="p-0053" num="0069">The reaction of step i) may be carried out in a solvent, preferably in an anhydrous solvent. Suitable solvents are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylenes, and similar solvents. It is also possible to use polar aprotic solvents e.g. ethers, such as tetrahydrofurane, dioxane, N,N-dialkylamides, such as dimethylformamide and diemthylacetamide, N-alkyl lactames such as N-methyl pyrrolidone, and mixtures thereof as well as mixtures thereof with the aforementioned hydrocarbons.</p>
 <p id="p-0054" num="0070">The reaction temperature is usually at least 70&#xb0; C. and is preferably 70 to 200&#xb0; C., in particular 100 to 180&#xb0; C. The reaction can be carried out in the reactors customary for this purpose. The application of increased pressure is, in principle, not necessary. However, it is advantageous if the components in the reaction are volatile as is the case when R<sup>1 </sup>is hydrogen. The reaction pressure can be up to 50 bar, preferably up to 10 bar. A skilled person will appreciate, that side chains of formula I having a cooligomeric structure can be obtained either by adding a mixture of different epoxides of formula III, which will lead to a random distribution of the different moieties, or by sequential addition of different epoxides, which will lead to a blockwise arrangement.</p>
 <p id="p-0055" num="0071">Work-up of the alkoxylated polyaminoamide obtained in the reaction of the non-modified polyaminoamide starting material with epoxide of formula III can be achieved in conventional manner. If the reaction was performed in an organic solvent, the reaction mixture is usually worked up by removing the solvent and replacing it by water. Thus, aqueous solutions of the alkoxylated polyamidoamines are obtained, which can be used directly in step ii) of the process according to the invention. It is of course also possible to isolate the alkoxylated polyaminoamides in substance by removing the volatile constituents from the reaction mixture. If no solvent was used the alkoxylated polyaminoamide will be obtained in substance after the reaction and can directly be used in step ii) of the process according to the invention.</p>
 <p id="p-0056" num="0072">It has been proven advantageous to treat the reaction product obtained in step ii) with small amounts of C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkylene oxide, in particular ethylene oxide. By this treatment, an, unpleasant odor, which results from amine by-products, can be reduced. The required amount of alkylene oxide is generally less than 0.8 mol per mol of amino hydrogen of the polyaminoamide starting material, in particular from 0.1 to 0.7 mol per mol of amino hydrogen. The treatment can be performed in a solvent, in particular in water. Preferably, the treatment is performed at a pH ranging from 4 to 10, in particular from 7 to 9. The treatment is preferably performed at temperatures ranging from 50 to 140&#xb0; C., in particular from 70 to 120&#xb0; C. Preferably, pressure is applied. The treated product can be stripped with steam in order to remove any impurities formed.</p>
 <p id="p-0057" num="0073">The alkoxylated polyaminoamides obtained in step i) are then reacted with an alkylating agent (step ii). As used herein, the term &#x201c;alkylating agent&#x201d; refers to a compound R&#x2014;X, wherein R is as defined above and X is a leaving group, which is capable of being replaced by nitrogen, and to oxiranes having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, usually C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkylene oxides. Suitable leaving groups X are halogen, especially chlorine, bromine or iodine, sulfate (i.e. &#x2014;O&#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>H or &#x2014;O&#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>), alkylsulfonate such as methylsulfonate, arylsulfonate such as tolylsulfonate, and alkyl sulfate, such as methosulfate (i.e. &#x2014;O&#x2014;SO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;OCH<sub>3</sub>). Preferred alkylating agents R&#x2014;X are C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkyl halides, Bis-(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkyl)sulfates and benzyl halides. Examples of such alkylating agents are ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, benzyl chloride, dimethyl sulfate and diethyl sulfate. Preferred C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkylene oxides as alkylating agents are ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.</p>
 <p id="p-0058" num="0074">The amount of alkylating agent determines the amount of quaternization of the amino groups in the polymer backbone, i.e. the amount of quaternized moieties (a), (b1) and (b2). In general, the amount of R&#x2014;X is from 0.1 mol to 2 mol, especially from 0.5 mol to 1.5 mol and more preferred from 0.7 mol to 1.2 mol per mol of amino groups in the modified polyaminoamide obtained in step i). In general, the amount of oxiranes used as alkylating agent is from 0.1 mol to 2 mol, especially from 0.5 mol to 2 mol and more preferred from 0.7 mol to 1.5 mol per mol of amino groups in the modified polyaminoamide obtained in step i).</p>
 <p id="p-0059" num="0075">If an alkylating agent R&#x2014;X is used, the reaction temperature is usually in the range of from 10 to 150&#xb0; C. and is preferably from 30 to 120&#xb0; C., in particular 50 to 110&#xb0; C., especially if dialkyl sulfates or benzyl chloride is used as alkylating agent.</p>
 <p id="p-0060" num="0076">The reaction can be carried out in reactors customary for this purpose. The application of increased pressure is, in principle, not necessary. However, it may be advantageous to apply increased pressure, if the alkylating agent is volatile. Then the pressure may be up to e.g. 50 bar.</p>
 <p id="p-0061" num="0077">The reaction can be carried out without any solvent. However, a solvent or diluent may be used. Suitable solvents or diluents are water, organic solvents having a high dipole moment, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, propionitrile, dialkylamides, such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide, N-methyllactams, such as N-methyl pyrrolidone, peralkylated ureas, such as tetramethyl urea, N,N&#x2032;-dimethylethylene urea, N,N&#x2032;-dimethylpropylene urea, etc. and mixtures thereof as well as mixtures thereof with water or with a less polar solvent, such as the aforementioned ethers and hydrocarbons.</p>
 <p id="p-0062" num="0078">Radicals R of the formula Alk-O&#x2014;H can be introduced by reacting the alkoxylated polyaminoamide obtained in step i) with C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkylene oxides, preferably ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, by analogy to the method described in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, 4<sup>th </sup>ed., vol. XI/2, p. 608-613. The reaction with alkylene oxides is usually carried out at temperatures from 30&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C., preferably from 30 and 100&#xb0; C. The reaction can be carried out in the absence of a solvent (solvent-free) or in any of the organic solvents mentioned above for the alkoxylation reaction in step i). The reaction must be carried out in the presence of a source for the required counter ions. The counter ions may be provided by water (OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) or by an acid. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an acid. Suitable acids are mineral acids such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid and hydrogen chloride. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of water and an acid to provide counter ions other than hydroxyl.</p>
 <p id="p-0063" num="0079">The application of increased pressure, either by addition of nitrogen or increased alkylene oxide pressure, can be advantageous in order to achieve higher degrees of quaternization.</p>
 <p id="p-0064" num="0080">In the thus obtained cationic modified polyaminoamide, at least a part of the nitrogen atoms of the polymer backbone carry both a radical R and side chains of the formula I, wherein A is hydrogen. The counter ions, which are required to compensate the positive net charge of the modified polyaminoamide usually correspond to the group X of the alkylating agent. If alkylation is performed by reaction with an oxirane, the counter ion corresponds to the acid used as catalyst.</p>
 <p id="p-0065" num="0081">The thus obtainable cationic modified polyaminoamides carry hydroxyl groups as terminal groups of the side chains of formula I and, if present, in the form of groups Alk-OH. These hydroxyl groups can be esterified in step iii), thereby obtaining &#x201c;,polyaminoamides of the invention, wherein A is selected from PO((OH)<sub>2 </sub>and S(O)<sub>2</sub>OH. These hydroxyl groups can also be etherified with compounds of the formula L-B<sup>3</sup>-A&#x2032; as defined above.</p>
 <p id="p-0066" num="0082">The esterification can be achieved by reacting the modified polyaminoamides obtained in step ii) with sulfuric acid or with a derivative thereof, e.g. with chlorosulfonic acid, sulfur trioxide, amidosulfonic acid, if a SO<sub>3</sub>H group shall be introduced as radical A. In order to produce the phosphate esters, i.e. A is PO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, the modified polyaminoamides obtained in step ii) are reacted with a suitable derivative of phosphoric acid, such as polyphosphate, phosphoryl chloride/water or phosphorpentoxide. Methods for esterification of terminal hydroxyl groups in polyether chains are in principle known in the art and can be applied in analogy to obtain the polyaminoamides of the present invention (see e.g. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Sixth Edition, 2000 Electronic Release SURFACTANTS&#x2014;Anionic Surfactants (Kurt Kosswig) 6.3. Sulfates and 6.4 phosphates; THIN-FILM REACTORS&#x2014;Thin Film Reactors for Industrial Sulfonation (Bernhard Gutsche, Christoph Breucker, G&#xfc;nter Panthel); CHLOROSULFURIC ACID&#x2014;Chemical Properties (Joachim Maas, Fritz Baunack); Stache (Hrsg.), Anionic Surfactants&#x2014;Organic Chemistry, S. 647-696, New York: Dekker 1995.</p>
 <p id="p-0067" num="0083">If sulfuric acid or oleum is used, an excess of the sulfating agent is usually employed. The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature ranging from 40 to 130&#xb0; C., preferably from 60 to 110&#xb0; C. The reaction is preferably carried out in the absence of a solvent. Usually reduced pressure is applied. Preferably the pressure is below 20 mbar.</p>
 <p id="p-0068" num="0084">Preferably a inert gas such as nitrogen is lead through the reaction mixture as a stripping gas. The reaction may also be carried out in an inert solvent. Then the solvent preferably has a boiling point above 120&#xb0; C. The amount of sulfuric acid (or oleum) determines the degree of sulfation (i.e. the ratio of side chains I carrying a group SO<sub>3</sub>H to side chains carrying a hydrogen atom).</p>
 <p id="p-0069" num="0085">In case of chlorosulfonic acid as esterifying agent usually equimolar amounts or a slight excess with respect to the desired stoichiometry, are used. The excess usually will not exceed 10 mol-%. The reaction temperature usually ranges from &#x2212;10 to 60&#xb0; C., preferably from &#x2212;10 to 40&#xb0; C. The reaction can be carried in a common solvent, which is inert towards chlorosulfonic acid. The reaction may also be carried out in the absence of a solvent. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an auxiliary base in order to neutralize the hydrogen chloride formed in the reaction. Suitable bases comprise alkali metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates and tertiary amines. The base is usually employed in at least equimolar amounts with respect to the amount of chlorosulfonic acid.</p>
 <p id="p-0070" num="0086">In case of sulfur trioxide acid as esterifying agent usually equimolar amounts of sulfur trioxide; based on the desired stoichiometry are employed. The reaction can be carried out in analogy to the method described in W. H. de Groot: Sulfonation Technology in Detergent Industry, Kluwer Academic Publ., Dordrecht 1991. The reaction is usually carried out in a continuously operating short-time sulfonation reactor. Generally the reaction temperature does not exceed 50&#xb0; C. and preferably ranges from &#x2212;10 to 50&#xb0; C. Preferably sulfur trioxide is diluted, preferably with air or an inert gas such as nitrogen. Preferably sulfur trioxide is diluted from 1 to 10 vol-%. The reaction product is usually neutralized with a base, e.g. a base mentioned for the reaction with chlorosulfonic acid, preferably sodium hydroxide. Preferably the reaction mixture is neutralized as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p id="p-0071" num="0087">The introduction of phosphate groups by use of polyphosphoric acid is usually performed at temperatures ranging from 20 to 150&#xb0; C., preferably from 50 to 120&#xb0; C. The reaction time may range from 0.5 to 24 h, preferably from 1 to 12 h. With respect to the desired degree of phosphation at least an equimolar amount of reactive phosphorous compound has to be employed. In general, the amount will be from 1 to 10 mol per mol of hydroxyl groups to be phosphatized. It may be advantageous to conduct the reaction under increased pressure by nitrogen. The reaction can be performed in common organic solvents, or, preferably, solvent-free.</p>
 <p id="p-0072" num="0088">If a dialkylsulfate is used for the quaternization of the nitrogen atoms, a part of the acidic groups are always sulfate groups, because a trans-sulfation reaction (see below) occurs during the reaction with the phosphorous compounds. The use of phosphorous pentoxide as phosphation reaction yields mono- as well as diesters.</p>
 <p id="p-0073" num="0089">Modified polyaminoamides of the invention, wherein A is SO<sub>3</sub>H and R is C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkyl, especially methyl, can be also obtained from the alkoxylated modified polyaminoamides obtained in step i) by reaction with di-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkylsulfates, especially dimethyl sulfate, according to the process described in WO 02/12179. This process is referred to as &#x201c;trans-sulfation&#x201d;. Hereby the di-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkylsulfate reacts with the alkoxylated polyaminoamide of step i) to yield the quaternized product of step ii) which contains mono-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkylesters of sulfuric acid as counter ions. These mono-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>-alkylesters of sulfuric acid act as a sulfating agent in step iii).</p>
 <p id="p-0074" num="0090">The trans-sulfation reaction is usually carried out at a pH below 2.5. The reaction temperature is usually from 40 to 130&#xb0; C., preferably from 60 to 110&#xb0; C. Preferably the reaction is carried out in the absence of a solvent. Preferably reduced pressure is applied. More preferably the pressure is below 20 mbar. It has been proven advantageous to lead, an inert gas, such as nitrogen through the reaction mixture as a stripping gas. The reaction may also be carried out in an inert solvent. Then the solvent preferably has a boiling point above 120&#xb0; C.</p>
 <p id="p-0075" num="0091">The introduction of the group B<sup>3</sup>-A&#x2032; at the termini of the polyether side chains I, especially of a carboxylic acid functionality B<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;COOH, can be achieved by etherification of the terminal hydroxyl groups of I with halocarboxylic acids Hal-B<sup>2</sup>&#x2014;COOH (Hal=halogen, especially chlorine or bromine, B<sup>2 </sup>as defined above), especially with &#x3b1;-halocarboxylic acids, such as chloroacetic acid. The etherification can be performed by analogy to known methods for the production of carboxymethylcellulose (Houben-Weyl E20, p. 2072-2076 and Ullmann, 5th ed., A5, p. 477-478). Usually the reaction will be performed in the presence of a base, which is preferably employed in large excess, based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. Preferred bases are alkaline, such as NaOH or KOH. The halocarboxylic acid is usually employed in excess, based on the desired stoichiometry. The reaction can either be conducted solvent-free, in water, in an inert organic solvent, preferably in an alkanol, such as isopropyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol etc. or in a ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl keton, in a mixture of the aforementioned solvents or in a mixture of at least one of these solvents with water.</p>
 <p id="p-0076" num="0092">The modified polyaminoamides obtained according to the invention may also be subjected to a discoloration step, e.g. by reacting them with hydrogen peroxide.</p>
 <p id="p-0077" num="0093">The modified polyaminoamides according to the invention are useful in particular as additives for solid and liquid laundry detergents. They excellently disperse particulate soiling in the aqueous wash liquor and thus prevent redeposition of the soiling onto the fabric during washing. Thereby they prevent graying of the textiles. In addition, they improve the primary detergency of both liquid and of solid detergents in particular with respect to particulate soiling, especially with respect to mineral soiling, such as clay minerals, which are the major components of earth-like soiling. However, also hydrophobic, oil- and grease-containing soilings are removed more easily by detergent compositions containing the modified polyaminoamides of the invention. In particular, detergent compositions containing the modified polyaminoamides are superior in removing earth-like soilings from surfaces especially from fabrics. In addition, modified polyaminoamides of the invention can be easily incorporated into solid and liquid detergent formulations without impairing the stability and homogeneity of these formulations. Undesired phase formations and precipitations are not observed even upon prolonged storage.</p>
 <p id="p-0078" num="0094">The modified polyaminoamides of the invention also show excellent dispersing properties for fine particulate solids, e.g. for organic pigments and in particular for inorganic pigments and inorganic fillers. Therefore, the invention also relates to the use of the modified polyaminoamides as defined above as dispersants. They are especially useful for dispersing inorganic pigments in aqueous medial. Inorganic pigments and fillers, for which the modified polyaminoamides of the invention are useful dispersants, comprise colored pigments, black pigments, luster pigments, transparent pigments, luminous pigments, anti-corrosive pigments, magnetic pigments and especially white pigments such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, and also fine particulate fillers, such as calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, talcum and also pigment soot and graphite.</p>
 <p id="p-0079" num="0095">The modified polyaminoamides of the invention are especially useful as dispersing aids for mineral pigments, especially for clay, such as kaolin, bentonite and for clay minerals, such as kaolinit, illites, smektites (e.g. montmorillonit) and chlorite.</p>
 <p id="p-0080" num="0096">The modified polyaminoamides of the invention stabilize dispersions of, particulate solids of low, medium and high concentration. They are especially useful for stabilizing dilute dispersions (e.g. 0,001-1% by weight of particulate solids), which are in particular sensitive to interfering substances such as the hardness components of water or anionic surfactants. However, dispersions of medium as well as of high concentrations of up to 85% by weight can be stabilized effectively.</p>
 <p id="p-0081" num="0097">In general, the amount of modified polyaminoamides which is necessary to achieve a stable dispersion will be at least 0.05% by weight, and preferably at least 0.1% by weight, based on the amount of pigment to be dispersed. Usually the modified polyaminoamides will be employed in amounts from 0.05 to 5% by weight and especially from 0.1 to 2% by weight.</p>
 <p id="p-0082" num="0098">It must be noted that the modified polyaminoamides of the invention show excellent dispersant properties even in the presence of compounds, such as water-hardening ions, e.g. calcium and magnesium or anionic surfactants, which usually impair the properties of conventional dispersants, such as polymers based on acrylic acid and/or maleic acid or sodium carboxymethylcellulose.</p>

 <p id="h-0005" num="0000">1. Reaction with 1 mol Ethylene Oxide Per mol NH-Groups (General Procedure)</p>
 <p id="p-0089" num="0105">The aqueous solution of the polyaminoamide was charged into a 2 l metal reactor and then rendered inert by applying 3 to 5 bar of nitrogen for 3 times. The reactor contents were heated to 90-130&#xb0; C. and then the required amount of ethylene oxide was added in portions (total amount equimolar to the amino hydrogens present in the polyaminoamide) in such a way that the pressure slowly rose. The pressure was then further increased by addition of nitrogen until a pressure of 5-8 bar was reached and the reaction mixture was then stirred at 90-130&#xb0; C. until the pressure remained constant. Following cooling to 70-80&#xb0; C. (50&#xb0; C. for C9) the reactor was flushed with 3 bar of nitrogen and residual ethylene oxide was removed on a rotary evaporator. The resulting alkoxylated polyaminoamide was yellow or lightly brown in color and depending on the active content, the degree of condensation and the identity of the amine and acid component the product was a liquid of high viscosity or a solid.</p>
 <p id="h-0006" num="0000">2. Preparation of the Alkoxylated Polyamiodamines C1 to C7 (General Procedures A to C)</p>
 <p id="h-0007" num="0000">Method A:</p>
 <p id="p-0090" num="0106">The aqueous solution of the modified polyaminoamide obtained according to step 1, the catalyst and xylene were charged in a 2 l metal reactor and rendered inert as described above. The mixture was heated to 130-160&#xb0; C. under a nitrogen stream to remove the water from the reaction mixture. The reactor content was cooled down to 120-150&#xb0; C. and then ethylene oxide was added in portions in such a way that the pressure slowly rose. The pressure was then further increased by addition of nitrogen until a pressure of 5-8 bar was reached and the reaction mixture was then stirred at 120-150&#xb0; C. until the pressure remained constant. Following cooling to 80&#xb0; C. the reactor was flushed with 3 bar of nitrogen to remove residual ethylene oxide. Xylenes were removed at 120&#xb0; C. by introducing 4 bar of hot steam. The alkoxylated polyaminoamide was obtained as a dark brown aqueous solution with an active content of 67% and a pH of 10.5.</p>
 <p id="h-0008" num="0000">Method B:</p>
 <p id="p-0091" num="0107">The aqueous solution of the polyaminoamide obtained according to step 1 and the catalyst were mixed and water and other volatile components were removed at 80-120&#xb0; C. under reduced pressure. The mixture was charged into a 2 l metal reactor and rendered inert as described above. At 120-150&#xb0; C. the alkylene oxide was then added in portions in such a way that the pressure slowly rose. The pressure was then further increased by addition of nitrogen, until a pressure of 5-8 bar was-reached, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 120-150&#xb0; C., until the pressure remained constant. In case of stepwise addition of different akylene oxides, a period of at least 2 hours, during which the pressure remained constant, was allowed to pass after addition of each alkylene oxide before the next alkyleneoxide was added. Following cooling to 80-90&#xb0; C. the reactor was flushed with 3 bar of nitrogen and residual ethylene oxide was removed in a rotary evaporator.</p>
 <p id="h-0009" num="0000">Method C:</p>
 <p id="p-0092" num="0108">Water was removed from the aqueous solution of the polyaminoamide obtained according to step 1 at 80-120&#xb0; C. under reduced pressure. The mixture was cooled to 50&#xb0; C. and under a nitrogen atmosphere the catalyst was added and volatile compounds were again removed from the mixture at 80-120&#xb0; C. under reduced pressure. The mixture was charged into a 2 l metal reactor and rendered inert as described above. At 120-150&#xb0; C. the alkyleneoxide was added in portions in such a way that the pressure slowly rose. The pressure was then further increased by addition of nitrogen, until a pressure of 5-8 bar was reached, and then the reaction mixture was stirred at 120-150&#xb0; C., until the pressure remained constant. Following cooling to 80-90&#xb0; C. the reactor was flushed with 3 bar of nitrogen and residual ethylene oxide was removed on a rotary evaporator.</p>

Then 928 g ethylene oxide were added within 5 hours at 120&#xb0; C. and the reaction mixture was stirred for further 2 hours until the pressure remained constant. Following cooling to 80&#xb0; C., the reactor was flushed with nitrogen to remove residual ethylene oxide. 1055 g product were obtained having 24 mol ethylene oxide per mol of amino groups. The amine titer was 0.823 mmol/g.</p>
 <p id="p-0097" num="0113">814 g of the compound of the previous step were diluted with 90.4 g of water and sulfuric acid (96%, 8.89 g) was added. The reactor was flushed three times with 5 bar of nitrogen. Then the reactor was heated to 90&#xb0; C. and ethylene oxide (28 g) was added in portions and the reaction mixture was stirred for further 3 hours at 90&#xb0; C. Then the reaction mixture was heated to 115&#xb0; C. and steam was introduced for 1.5 hours at 4 bar. After cooling to 100&#xb0; C., a vacuum of 20 mbar was applied in order to remove residual water. 807 g of the modified compound were obtained (amine titer 0.697 mmol/g).</p>

The reactor contents were heated to 90&#xb0; C. and 183.3 g ethylene oxide were added in portions. The reaction mixture was stirred until the pressure remained constant. After cooling to 50&#xb0; C., the reactor was flushed three times with 3 bar of nitrogen. 1350 g of a 63.5% aqueous solution of the reaction product were obtained (amine titer 2.83 mmol/g). 260 g of the aqueous reaction mixture and 2.28 g potassium hydroxide (40% aqueous solution) were charged into a 2 l metal reactor and the reactor was flushed with 5 bar of nitrogen. The reactor contents were heated to 120&#xb0; C. and a vacuum of &#x3c;10 mbar was applied to remove water. After 4 hours the reactor was flushed with nitrogen. 789.5 g of ethylene oxide were added at 120&#xb0; C. and the reaction mixture was stirred until the pressure remained constant. Following cooling to 80&#xb0; C., the reactor was flushed three times with 5 bar of nitrogen. Thereby, 964 g of ethoxylated polyaminoamide with 24 mol EO per mol of aminic hydrogen was obtained. 432.3 g of the thus obtained compound were charged into a 2 l metal reactor and the reactor was flushed for three times with 5 bar of nitrogen. The reactor was heated to 120&#xb0; C. The reactor was evacuated to &#x3c;10 mbar at 120&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. Then the reactor was flushed again with nitrogen and 168 g of ethylene oxide were added at 120&#xb0; C. and the reaction mixture was stirred until the pressure remained constant. After cooling to 80&#xb0; C., the reactor was flushed three times with 5 bar of nitrogen. Thereby, 610 g of a compound having about 35.6 mol ethylene oxide per mol of aminic NH was obtained.

 <p id="p-0112" num="0131">To a fine dispersion of 0.30 g of China Clay (Imerys, Cornwall, UK) in 300 ml deionised water (pH 7.5, 400 ml glass beaker (diameter: 8,0 cm, with marks) 44 mg of calcium chloride monohydrate and 95 mg of a linear C<sub>12</sub>-alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) are added with stirring at room temperature. Then 10 ppm, based on the dispersion, of the polymer to be tested is added and stirring is continued for 10 min. Then the stirrer is stopped. After 20 min. and 50 min a sample is taken with a pipet at a defined height of the beaker (175 ml mark). The sample is immediately transferred into a cuvette (1 cm) and the extinction at 600 nm is determined in a photometer. The higher the extinction the better is the dispersing action. The results are given in table 6.</p>

# Digit Recogniser
Recognise Digits based on the input Digits provided. 

#Description: 
In this project, we use the digit data  as provided  data  from the [Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/), 
along with  the [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) digit dataset  and generate
a statistical Logistic Regression Model model to predict the Digits from the image .


## Getting Started Guide:
Step 1 : You need to install ipython and  jupyter notebook as
```
pip install ipython
pip install jupyter
```

Step 2: Go to the directory containing the project then open the notebook as
```
jupyter notebook
```

Step 3:  Then jupyter notebook will open in the browser. 
Step 4: Traverse to the ".ipynb" file and you can then change or run the program as desired in the browser notebook itself.

## Project Structure
- notMNIST_large.tar.gz : The  digit data  containing digits from A to J contained in each folder, pertaining to the the digits.
- "1_notmnist.html" : This is the "html" version of the project and can be directly viewed in the browser.
- "1_notmnist.pynb" : This is the  ipython notebook file of the project. If you want to tweak it, make changes and play around, then you can open the ipython notebook file in the jupyter notebook and run it directly in your browser, as you go on making the changes.

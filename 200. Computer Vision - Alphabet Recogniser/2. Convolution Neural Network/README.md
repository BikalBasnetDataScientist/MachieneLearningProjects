# Digit Recogniser 
Predict the digit from the image  based on the image provided.

#Description: 
In this project, we  use the   both the MNIST and non-MNIST digit image data set to train out model to recognise th digits correctly.


## Getting Started Guide:

### Install

Step 1: This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [H5py](http://www.h5py.org/)
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [sklearn](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Scipy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project Structure
- "Normal Gradient vs SGD vs Deep Neural Network - Case study  on Digit Recognition Problem.ipynb" :  Python notebook,  in which we try diffrenet techniques ranging from Normal Gradient to Stochastic Gradient to Deep Learning Network and test  different approaches, their pros and cons.
- "Normal Gradient vs SGD vs Deep Neural Network - Case study  on Digit Recognition Problem.html" : Html version of the case study. Can be viewed in browser to view quickly. 
- "notMNIST.pickle" : Input file for the normal gradient vs SGD vs Deep Neural Network program. Since all the data may not fit in the memory,  we  combine all the data into the pickle file i.e combine the 2 GB of data into 600MB for processing.

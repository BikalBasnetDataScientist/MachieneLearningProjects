This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#install.packages('Mcomp')
#install.packages('forecast')

library(Mcomp)
library(forecast)
# M3 data set's N1 series  yearly data
M3[[1]]
M3[[1998]]
M3[[1998]]$x

# indicates additive error,  additive trend, aditive seasonality
model <- ets(M3[[1998]]$x, model = "AAA")

model <- ets(M3[[1]]$x, model = "AAN")
summary(ets(M3[[1]]$x, model = "AAN"))   # rmse 115
summary(ets(M3[[1]]$x, model = "MAN"))    # rmse 97
summary(ets(M3[[1]]$x, model = "MMN"))    # rmse 116
summary(ets(M3[[1]]$x, model = "MMN"))    #rmse  116
summary(ets(M3[[1]]$x, model = "AAN"))    # rmse 115
summary(ets(M3[[1]]$x))

summary(model)

plot(model)
forecast.ets(model  )
M3[[1]]

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Product Sales Demand Forecaster - LSTM Deep Learning Neural Network 
Predict the product's sales demand based on the historical sales data.

#Description: 
In this project, we  use the  retail products  historical demand data to anticipate the future purchasing action of the customers.
We will use the statistical time series analysis prediction approach to find the statistical patterns and change in patterns of the sales.
We use the Non-paramteric  state of the art deep neural netowrk, Long Short Tem Memory Neural Network to make the forecasts.
For further detail and report, please refer to the report "Report- Sales Demand Forcaster.pdf"
